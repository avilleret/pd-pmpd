Description: physical modeling library for Pd
 These objects provide real-time simulations, specially physical
 behaviors. pmpd can be used to create natural dynamic systems, like a
 bouncing ball, string movement, Brownian movement, chaos, fluid dynamics,
 sand, gravitation, and more. It can also be used to create displacements thus
 allowing a completely dynamic approach of pd computing.
